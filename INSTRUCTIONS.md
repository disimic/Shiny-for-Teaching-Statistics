# Instructions for installation

In order to participate actively in the workshop you will have ti install on your computer programs R and RStudio, and R packages Rmarkdown, Shiny, and flexdashboard (plus packages they may depend on - but that can be done automatically). 

## Installing R

R is a free (both free as a bird, and free as no payment needed) language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, distributed under the GNU General Public Licence. It is available at https://www.r-project.org/ . When downloading, you will first be prompted to choose a CRAN Mirror. CRAN is the Comprehensive R Archive Network with servers all around the world. You should pick the mirror (i.e. server):

- with the fastest Internet connection to your network, or 
- the one closest to you geographically (if you have no idea - like the rest of us - just how fast your Internet connections to the rest of the world are). 

Once your mirror is chosen, you can download binary distributions of the base R system for Linux, macOS or Windows. Just download the code, and start it as an administrator. Obviously - you should have administrator, or at least installing rights on the computer you intend using at the workshop.

## Installing RStudio

R is great as a language and an interpreter, but its user interface leaves a lot to be desired. That's where RStudio jumps into the picture. We will need RStudio Desktop. You can download it from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ . Open Source Edition is free and distributed under the AGPL v3 licence. 

## Packages

The greatest thing about the R is that its functionality can be extended by packages. There are currently 18103 packages available on CRAN. You can browse the table of available packages at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html , or better, take a look at [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) where volunteers have created overviews of packages related to some common problems or methodologies.

Packages can be easily installed from RStudio. Just download the script `install_packages.R`, open it in RStudio, select all the text, and click on the icon Run at the top of the window in which the script is open. 

If everything went well, you are all set and ready for the workshop. If there were problems - we can still resolve them at the beginning of the workshop. So far, I haven't encountered a problem with downloading and installing these programs that could not be quickly resolved. If you manage to bring such a problem to BIOSTAT - I will buy you a consolation coffee after the workshop.

That's it! See you at the workshop.
