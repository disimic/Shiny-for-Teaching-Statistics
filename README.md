# BIOSTAT 2021
## 23rd SCHOOL OF BIOMETRICS:  Using Shiny Apps in Teaching Statistics
If picture is worth a thousand words, what's the worth of a moving picture? When teaching statistics, it is often easier to explain statistical concepts using simulation and visualization. Luckily, you can find many free interactive apps illustrating statistical concepts and  procedures on the Internet. Still, there are many occasions when you would  like to create your own app. Maybe your students do not speak English very well, or you would like to use your own data or example in the simulation, or you would just like to tweak one little aspect of the app to better suit your purpose. If you know basics of R and RStudio, and are familiar with ggplot2, you can easily create your own apps, which you can share with your students as files to be run in RStudio, or upload to a remote server and make accessible as web apps. 
In this School of Biometrics, we will cover the basics of the rmarkdown and shiny packages, and show how to create and share your own stat app.
To participate actively in the school, you will have to install R and RStudio on your laptop. You will also have to install some R packages. All the school materials, including instructions, slides, examples, and assignments will be available at the github repository https://github.com/disimic/biostat2021 .

Looking forward to seeing you in Poreč and on Zoom!
